                <h5>DATA PROCUREMENT</h5>
                <p>We aggregate anonymous data from all visitors to our website. Additionally, we gather details such as
                    web requests, the transmitted data in response to these requests, the Internet Protocol (IP)
                    address, browser type, browser language, and a timestamp indicating the request. The categories of
                    information we might gather encompass your name, email address, physical address, credit card
                    details, and any other contact or identifying information you decide to share. Your privacy is of
                    paramount importance to us, and we handle this information with the utmost care and respect.</p>
                <p>As an illustration, data is gathered when you establish an account, subscribe, engage in any
                    interactive elements of our services, complete a form, seek customer support, or otherwise interact
                    with us. All the information we gather will serve various purposes: keeping you informed about
                    updates (which you can opt out of by contacting us at <a href="support@vibrantauction.com"
                        target="_blank">support@vibrantauction.com</a>), soliciting your feedback, resolving issues, and
                    analyzing site statistics such as average time spent on the site and number of page views. These
                    insights <strong>enable us to identify areas for enhancement and continuously improve the
                        site.</strong></p>
                <p>We also employ diverse technologies to gather information, which may involve transmitting cookies to
                    your computer. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or device memory, aiding us in
                    enhancing our services and improving your experience. They allow us to identify popular areas and
                    features of our services and tally visits. Additionally, we may gather information through web
                    beacons, also referred to <strong>as "tracking pixels."</strong> These electronic images may be
                    utilized in our services or emails to track visits, understand usage patterns, and evaluate campaign
                    effectiveness. Rest assured, <strong>we prioritize the security and confidentiality</strong> of your
                    data and adhere to stringent privacy standards.</p>
                <h5>INFORMATION INTERCHANGE</h5>
                <p>We are committed to safeguarding your personally identifiable information. We do not disclose it to
                    external companies except for those acting as our agents in delivering our services to you. These
                    agents are contractually bound to use your information solely for the purpose of providing our
                    services and to maintain its security and confidentiality. In the event of a merger, acquisition, or
                    transfer of our assets, your personal information may be transferred to the acquiring entity under

                    law, such as in response to a court order, subpoena, or law enforcement request. In exceptional
                    circumstances, we may also share information to protect the rights, property, or safety of others,
                    or when necessary to identify or take legal action against individuals causing harm. We incorporate
                    social buttons provided by platforms such as <strong>LinkedIn, Twitter (X), Facebook and Google,

                    various application files. It's important to note that while we endeavor to ensure the safety and
                    reliability of the content we link to, users should exercise caution and review the terms of use and
                    privacy policies of any external websites or downloads they choose to access.</p>
